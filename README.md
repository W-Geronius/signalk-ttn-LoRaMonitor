# signalk-ttn-LoRaMonitor
Signal K Node Server Plugin to retrieve environment data from The Things Network (ttn)

This plugin has been developed to import data to SignalK as transmitted by the Open Boat Project's  [**'LoRa Boat Monitor'**](https://open-boat-projects.org/en/lora-bootsmonitor/ "click to read more")
Presently this plugin only supports a single sensor to be placed on the vessel for remote monitoring.

Further releases may also support:

* multiple devices (same payload data structure)
* multiple devices (different payload data structures)
* user definable payload definitions to be decoded at client side

**The project is considered as 'beta'**

Current version: v.0.2.2

PR welcome.
